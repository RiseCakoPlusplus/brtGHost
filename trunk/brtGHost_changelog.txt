ENGLISH:

- Fixed problem with namespoofing ( problem cached spoof list )
  Explain: i host on multiple realms. i set the bot to require spoofchecks for everyone. lets say "UserA" is admin on realm 
  1. Then some random guy took the "UserA" account on realm 
  2, joined one of my games, got spoofchecked correctly (but no admin rights till now). 
  right after that he connected to realm 1 where the real "UserA" is granted admin access. 
  Now he spoofed the UserA account on realm 1, 
  connected to a game and he wasnt spoof checked again, because name + ip was in cached spoof list from realm2. 
  therefore the namespoofing wasn't detected and e voila .. a random fag had unrightful admin access on my bot! 

- Disabled !GET, !SET and !SETNEW command.
  Explain: Incredible security breach in my opinion. as the above mentioned spoofattack (and i guess there is always room for more/different attacks) 
  would also work on root admins, your gamekeys are "free to go" Подмигивающий with the !get command you can get any value from the config file, 
  including the roc/tft keys - the only thing of real value on a bot imo Подмигивающий for what it's worth i threw both, the get and set command in bnet.cpp, 
  completely out. as nice as this feature was meant to be, i dont see the need to modify the cfg via bot/bnet.. that what a shell is made for.

- Fixed problem with ban system, namely the ban system is not multi realm capable if it comes to admins. lets say UserA is admin on realm1, 
  and i placed bans for UserA (just to avoid namespoofing on other realms..) on realm2, realm3 etc. (my admins always connect from same realm!) 
  But no matter what, "fake" UserA could still join games from realm 2, realm3 etc. Well, he got no admin rights, but he is still treated as safelisted/admin, 
  coz he cannot only join a game, but even join a full game and autokick someone else out - which most likely shouldn't happen.

- Fixed security bug, wich possible spoof attack by spoofing the owner name.

- Removed root admin default string. We dont want the user "root" to be rootadmin as default.
- Fixed bug with replays version.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.7.0.7
 - renamed ghost.cfg to default.cfg
  * the bot now loads default.cfg first then loads ghost.cfg (or the file specified on the command line) and overrides default.cfg with any values in ghost.cfg
  * added reloading of default.cfg before reloading the main config file (e.g. when using the !reload command)
 - added printing of Observer/Referee messages to the console and log file
 - added new map config value map_options
  * added support for custom maps that allow selectable teams, colours, and races
  * changed the meaning of SLOTRACE_FIXED to SLOTRACE_SELECTABLE as the previous meaning was incorrect
  * fixed the bot's logic for changing teams, colours, and races to take the map options into account
  * note: these changes may "break" existing map configs since previously the bot would assume a map was "custom" by default and now it assumes a map has selectable teams, colours, and races by default
 - fixed the "GameType" value being set incorrectly (using Strilanc's specification, thanks again!)
  * you can now specify the map filters that should apply to the games your bot creates
  * removed map config value map_gametype (its functionality has been replaced by map_options in a previous revision)

  * added map config value map_filter_obs

1.7.0.5 on September 20, 2010

- It's 100% compatible with GHost One GUI
- fix replay bug.
- fix bug with bans (someone banned player can join the game)
- fix flood in chat about ip bannig.
- Language class refactoring.
- Translated 95% of all text, full compatible english and russian language config file.
  Language translated it's not fully completed. We work on them
- In admin game lobby, you don't want to type password anytime. You must type
  password once, and bot store you name, ip. When you connect to admin lobby next,
  you don't type password yet.
- !ips command - now send ip info only to admin, nobody else will see it
- some optimizations that should reduce the time required to save replays
  * removed some unnecessary data from replays (player checksums)
  * the bot now builds a (mostly) complete replay in memory as the game progresses (rather than building the replay at the end of the game)
- fixed a bug where GHost++ would occasionally generate broken replays (anytime a "pretick" or w3gs_incoming_action2 was generated)
- fixed a bug where GProxy++ users would desync upon reconnection when load-in-game was enabled
- fixed a bug which allowed rehosting a game with a name over 31 characters (this causes a ban from Battle.net)
- fixed a bug which allowed a map_path longer than 49 characters (this causes a disconnect from Battle.net)
- Added UDP command "sendgamesstatus", it send back information about killed towers, rax kills, game name, game time, game creator.
- Added leave count and percent for !sd command. SQlite not support yet.
- Added !end <winner> command. Syntax - !end 1 - for winner SENTINEL, and !end 2 - for winner SOURGE. !end with no params work too.

- and other minor optimizations
